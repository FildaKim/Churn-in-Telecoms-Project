Churn in Telecoms: Customer Retention Strategy
Business Problem
SyriaTel, a telecommunications provider, is experiencing high customer churn, which negatively impacts revenue, growth, and customer loyalty. To address this issue, the company needs to identify key churn drivers and predict which customers are at risk of leaving. By understanding these factors, SyriaTel can develop targeted retention strategies, improve customer service, and optimize business performance.

Project Objectives
Identify Key Drivers of Customer Churn
Analyze customer data to uncover patterns that contribute to churn. This analysis will highlight features that can be used to predict customer attrition.

Build an Accurate Predictive Model
Develop and test machine learning models that classify customers who are likely to churn. This will enable SyriaTel to proactively target at-risk customers for retention.

Provide Strategic Recommendations
Offer actionable insights and retention strategies to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty, ultimately enhancing revenue and business sustainability.

Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 3,333 rows and 21 columns, containing information about SyriaTel’s customers, including account details, usage statistics, and subscription plans. The goal is to analyze this data, build a predictive model, and derive actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

Data Preparation & Processing
Data Splitting:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Encoding Categorical Variables:
Categorical features are encoded numerically using label encoding, ensuring compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

Handling Missing and Irrelevant Data:
Irrelevant and highly correlated features are removed to reduce complexity and avoid multicollinearity, which can affect model performance.

Feature Scaling:
Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler to ensure all features are on the same scale, which is critical for distance-based models.

Machine Learning Model
Random Forest Classifier:
Random Forest was chosen due to its high accuracy, ability to handle feature interactions, and robustness in handling imbalanced classes. The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Model Evaluation:
The model achieves an accuracy of 90.25%, indicating it can reliably predict customer churn. Cross-validation confirms the model’s stability, with an average accuracy of 91.26%.

Adjusting Model Thresholds:
Different thresholds are tested to balance precision and recall, helping SyriaTel focus on high-risk customers based on specific retention goals.

Model Comparison:
A Decision Tree Classifier is compared with the Random Forest model, and the latter is selected for its superior performance.

Key Findings
Churn Drivers:
Key factors driving churn include total day minutes, customer service calls, and total evening minutes. Customers with lower engagement or frequent customer service interactions are more likely to churn.

Model Performance:
The Random Forest model shows strong predictive power, identifying churn with 90.25% accuracy and outperforming simpler models like Decision Trees.

Strategic Recommendations
Target High-Risk Customers:
Focus retention efforts on customers with a high probability of churn. Personalized offers, discounts, or special services can help retain these customers.

Improve Customer Engagement:
Customers with lower usage or frequent service interactions should be targeted with tailored retention strategies to boost engagement and loyalty.

Proactive Customer Support:
Address issues before they escalate by offering proactive customer support, particularly for those who frequently contact customer service.

Conclusion
By leveraging machine learning to predict churn, SyriaTel can make data-driven decisions to reduce customer turnover and improve retention. The model provides valuable insights into the key factors driving churn and enables targeted, strategic interventions.
