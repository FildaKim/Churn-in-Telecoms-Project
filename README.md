## **Business Problem**
SyriaTel's customer churn challenges threaten its revenue and growth. Identifying key churn drivers and predicting at-risk customers can help SyriaTel:
- Develop targeted retention strategies.
- Enhance customer service quality.
- Improve overall business performance.

---

## **Project Objectives**
1. **Understand Key Drivers of Customer Churn**
   - Analyze data to identify critical factors contributing to churn behavior.
   - Derive actionable insights for decision-making.

2. **Build an Accurate Predictive Model**
   - Develop machine learning models to classify churn risk.
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Offer Strategic Recommendations**
   - Propose retention strategies based on predictions and insights.
   - Focus on high-risk customer engagement and loyalty improvement.

## **Dataset Summary**
- **Source**: SyriaTel Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle.
- **Shape**: 3333 rows, 21 columns.
- **Features**: Customer account details, usage statistics, and subscription plans.
- **Target Variable**: `churn` (Yes/No).

---

## **Analysis and Modeling**

### **Data Preparation**
1. **Data Splitting**: Dataset split into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.
2. **Encoding**: Categorical variables (`voice mail plan`, `international plan`, `state`) encoded into numeric format.
3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Irrelevant features (e.g., `area code`) and highly correlated features were dropped to improve model performance.
4. **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features were standardized using `StandardScaler`.

---

### **Key Features**
- **Total Day Minutes**: Indicates customer engagement; lower usage correlates with higher churn.
- **Customer Service Calls**: High call frequency correlates with churn, highlighting service quality issues.

#### **Feature Importance**
The following graph shows the importance of each feature in predicting customer churn, helping to identify which features most influence the model's decisions.

### **Modeling and Evaluation**

#### **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: **90.25%**
  - Precision (Churn): **0.65**
  - Recall (Churn): **0.67**
  - F1-Score (Churn): **0.66**

#### **Confusion Matrix**
Below is the confusion matrix for the Random Forest classifier, which helps visualize the model's performance on predicting churn versus non-churn customers.

#### **Cross-Validation**
- 5-fold cross-validation score: **91.26%**
- Demonstrates model consistency across subsets of data.

#### **Threshold Adjustment**
- Adjusted thresholds (e.g., 0.3, 0.5, 0.7) to balance precision and recall.
- Optimal threshold selected based on business goals.

#### **Model Comparison**
- **Decision Tree**: 86% accuracy.
- **Random Forest**: Outperformed Decision Tree in accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

## **Strategic Recommendations**
1. **Engage High-Risk Customers**
   - Use model predictions to identify high-risk customers (churn probability > 90%).
   - Offer loyalty rewards, discounts, or personalized plans to retain these customers.

2. **Improve Customer Service**
   - Focus on customers with high service call frequency.
   - Proactively resolve issues to enhance satisfaction.

3. **Personalized Retention Strategies**
   - Target low-engagement customers (low `Total Day Minutes`).
   - Offer incentives to increase usage and strengthen loyalty.

---

## **Model Deployment**
- **Trained Model**: Random Forest Classifier.
- **Saved Model**: Exported using `pickle` for deployment.
- **Usage**:
  - Predict churn for new customers.
  - Integrate predictions into SyriaTelâ€™s CRM system for targeted outreach.

---

## **Business Insights**
1. **Key Churn Drivers**: Focus retention efforts on top features like `Total Day Minutes` and `Customer Service Calls`.
2. **Targeted Campaigns**: Allocate resources to high-risk customers for maximum impact.
3. **Enhanced Support**: Address customer service pain points to reduce churn risk.
