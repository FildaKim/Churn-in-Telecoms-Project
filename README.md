Churn In Telecoms Dataset: Phase 3 Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn using machine learning models. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving a telecom company (churn) based on customer behavior and service usage patterns from the Churn in Telecoms Dataset.

Business and Data Understanding
Stakeholder
The stakeholder for this project is a telecommunication company seeking to reduce customer turnover by predicting customers likely to churn, by implementing intervention strategies
Business Problem
Customer churn rates lead to revenue loss for telecom companies. By accurately predicting the churn rates and understanding the factors causing them, the business can design retention strategies tailored to at-risk customers, therefore increasing customer satisfaction and profitability

Dataset Overview
This analysis uses the Churn in Telecoms Dataset from Kaggle. It contains customer demographics, account details, and usage patterns, providing insights into patterns and predictors related to customer churn.

Objectives
1. Data Exploration & Preparation: Explore the Churn in Telecoms dataset, handle missing values, preprocess data, and prepare it for machine learning modeling.
2. Model Building & Comparison: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models (baseline and tuned) to identify the best approach for predicting customer churn.
3. Insight Generation & Recommendations: Provide insights into feature importance and actionable recommendations for the business to address customer churn.

Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
